# Blackjack

Blackjack was a first semester project in which I learned to implement some basic logic and visualisation. The betting portion was never implemented.

## Constraints 

- A deck contains 52 cards; ace to king of every type.
- The game begins by giving both the player and dealer 2 cards. The dealer's second card stays closed and the player goes first.
- The game automatically counts your points. You lose if you go above 21 points.
- The player can continue drawing cards or stop as long as their points are smaller than or equal to 21.
- The dealer draws cards until their points are larger than or equal to 17. 
- The game compares the points and declares who has won.
- If the player starts out with 21 points he wins immediately.

## Personal Goals

Because this was a first semester project, the main goal was to gain experience implementing the necessary logic. It was also one of my first times utilising classes, so the other goal was to experiment.  

I did so by creating the three classes "Hand", "Deck" and "Card". While the quality of the code could be improved on, I learned a lot by trying out various techniques.
